about=This plugin provides a complete workflow to convert LiDAR point clouds (LAS/LAZ format) into 3D tree models suitable for the microclimate simulation software ENVI‑met. Users can interactively select a trunk point and define a region of interest, apply percentile‑based filtering to isolate tree points, and then scale, rotate, or translate the point cloud to match desired dimensions. The plugin voxelises the data at 1 m resolution and calculates Leaf Area Density (LAD) values using user‑selected reference voxels. Further refinements such as crown factor adjustment, trunk enhancement, LAD thresholding, and ground clearing are available. Physiological A‑gs parameters can be chosen from species presets or entered manually. The final tree can be exported as an ENVI‑met plant file (.txt) and optionally inserted directly into an existing project database. Designed for researchers and urban planners, the plugin bridges the gap between high‑resolution LiDAR data and microclimate modelling in ENVI‑met. Some of the tools in las2ENVImet require the Python libraries laspy, lazrs and matplotlib, which are not included in the default installation of QGIS. See the "Dependencies" section in the README file.
